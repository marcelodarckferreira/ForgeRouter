# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

ForgeRouter (formerly ProxyRouter; Hermes AI Proxy Router): a FastAPI service exposing one OpenAI-compatible API (`/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/models`) that routes requests across multiple LLM providers (local Ollama, Groq, OpenRouter, Mistral) with health-based selection and automatic fallback. Two protocol translators sit in front of the same routing/fallback path: `/v1/messages` (Anthropic Messages API, for Claude Code) and `/v1/responses` (OpenAI Responses API, for the Codex CLI — it requires `wire_api = "responses"` since v0.138 and has no Chat Completions fallback). Listens on port 2100. The PRD lives in `docs/HERMES_AI_PROXY_ROUTER_PRD_v2.md`.

## Commands

Everything runs in Docker — the host Python runtime does not have the required dependencies.

```bash
# Build image — always use this, not a bare `docker compose build`: it bakes the
# commit into the image (GET /health exposes it) and retags the result as
# forgerouter:<VERSION file> + forgerouter:latest, so every `docker run` below
# always runs current code. (A plain `docker compose build` only produces
# forgerouter-forgerouter:latest — the forgerouter:latest tag other tooling and
# cron reference then goes stale silently; this bit us for over a week once.)
./scripts/build.sh

# Run all tests
docker compose run --rm forgerouter pytest -q

# Run a single test file / test
docker compose run --rm forgerouter pytest tests/test_chat_fallback.py -q
docker compose run --rm forgerouter pytest tests/test_chat_fallback.py::test_chat_falls_back_to_next_candidate -q

# Run the service locally (host networking — required so the container can reach
# Ollama on 127.0.0.1:11434; the bridge-network docker-compose.yml cannot)
docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d --build

# Provider health scan (writes to DB with --persist). Networking: the live service
# joins foundation_network (docker-compose.yml), so one-off `docker run` invocations
# (cron, ad hoc) must join the same network and re-add the host-gateway mapping
# `docker compose` injects automatically (docker-compose.yml `extra_hosts`) — plain
# --network host resolves host.docker.internal to a different address that
# foundation_postgres's pg_hba.conf rejects, so DATABASE_URL connects fail silently.
docker run --rm --network foundation_network --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  --env-file .env forgerouter:latest python -m app.validation.scanner --persist

# Rotating-batch health scan for cron (scans a % of the model pool per run instead of
# all of it, so a frequent cadence doesn't burn free-tier quotas — see script docstring
# for the suggested crontab line, flock guard and --percent tuning)
docker run --rm --network foundation_network --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  --env-file .env -e PYTHONPATH=/app forgerouter:latest python3 scripts/health_scan_sync.py --percent 20

# Reference-cost pricing sync (catalog + live provider pricing + historical backfill;
# same three steps as clicking Sync on the LLM Pricing dashboard page — put this in cron)
docker run --rm --network foundation_network --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  --env-file .env -e PYTHONPATH=/app forgerouter:latest python3 scripts/sync_pricing.py

# Health check (also reports version/git_sha — compare against `docker images`
# or `git rev-parse HEAD` to catch a stale running container)
curl http://127.0.0.1:2100/health
```

The frontend dashboard (`frontend/`, Vite + React + TypeScript) is served from `frontend/dist`, which the Dockerfile copies into the image. Rebuild it with `npm run build` in `frontend/` before rebuilding the image when dashboard code changes.

## Architecture

Request flow for `/v1/chat/completions` (`app/main.py`):

1. `load_registry_with_db_health()` loads the provider registry from PostgreSQL (`ai_router.providers` + `ai_router.models` — the source of truth, managed via the dashboard/CRUD endpoints), falling back to `config/providers.yaml` when the DB is unreachable or empty. It then overlays each model's `healthy` flag with the latest status from `ai_router.provider_health`.
2. Capability is inferred from the request (`tool_call` if `tools` present, else `text`). Candidates are healthy+enabled models with that capability, sorted by tier ascending (tier 1 = highest priority; local Ollama is tier 4, the fallback of last resort).
3. Candidates are tried in order. A specific `model` in the request is a preference, not an exclusive filter — it is sorted first, and the remaining healthy candidates stay as automatic fallback (a free-tier 429 on the requested model must never stop the caller). Any HTTP >= 400 or exception records a route event in `ai_router.route_events`, persists an unhealthy health row for that model (`mark_runtime_failure_unhealthy`), and moves to the next candidate. Only when all candidates fail does it return 502 `all_providers_failed`.

Key modules:

- `app/registry.py` — YAML registry parsing, DB health overlay, provider readiness (reports whether API-key env vars are set, never the values).
- `app/providers/openai_compatible.py` — the default provider client (OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions`). Each provider has an `api_format` (`openai`, the default, or `anthropic`); `anthropic` providers route through `app/providers/anthropic_compatible.py`, a generic Anthropic Messages API (`/v1/messages`) client that reuses the Claude Code adapter's payload/stream translation without the OAuth particularities — the router, scanner and usage accounting keep speaking chat completions either way. Plan handlers (`app/providers/plans.py`) take precedence over `api_format`.
- Incoming protocol translators (`app/main.py`), ahead of the same `chat_completions()` routing/fallback path: `/v1/messages` (Anthropic Messages API, for Claude Code) and `/v1/responses` (OpenAI Responses API, for Codex CLI — required since Codex dropped `wire_api = "chat"` in v0.138). Both build a `ChatCompletionRequest`, call `chat_completions()` internally, then translate the result back; a streaming client gets a synthesized SSE burst (the full message replayed as an event sequence after the fact), not real incremental provider streaming.
- `app/pricing.py` — reference/notional cost estimation for free-tier requests: real `usage.cost` is almost always absent because paid models are excluded at discovery (see below), so this estimates what a request would have cost at public commercial rates for an equivalent model, purely as an opportunity-cost figure — never billed, never confused with real `cost`. Three-tier lookup, highest priority first: live pricing read from each registered provider's own `/models` response (`config/model_pricing_live.json`, the literal endpoint being routed through) → hand-curated `config/model_pricing_overrides.json` (sourced, for models neither other tier covers) → vendored LiteLLM catalog `config/model_pricing.json`. Never guesses — no match means no reference cost. `POST /admin/pricing/sync` (admin-gated) refreshes all three tiers and backfills historical `route_events`/`usage_monthly`; `scripts/sync_pricing.py` runs the same thing for cron.
- `app/validation/scanner.py` + `app/validation/health.py` — health scanner sends a real chat completion to each model and classifies the response. `health.py` detects "silent failures": HTTP 200 responses with empty content or quota/billing/auth error text in the body are marked unhealthy.
- `app/storage.py` — all PostgreSQL access (psycopg, raw SQL against schema `ai_router`).

Design rules baked into the code:

- **Demand routing** (`app/demand.py`, dashboard "Tasks" page): virtual models `forgerouter/auto|simple|standard|complex|reasoning|vision|audio|code` are exposed in `/v1/models`. `auto`/`forgerouter/auto` classifies each request into a demand class — image parts → vision; code signals in the last user message (fences, file extensions, word-bounded CODE_HINTS) → code; word-bounded reasoning hints → reasoning; else prompt size + tools, where history chars count at a 1/`HISTORY_DISCOUNT` discount so short follow-ups in long conversations don't drift to complex. Vision/audio/code chains are capability-gated (catalog). The resolved demand is persisted per route event (`route_events.demand`, NULL for concrete-model requests) for auditing. Each class routes through an ordered model chain (`ai_router.demand_routes`, or a rank-derived default from `default_chain`), then through every other healthy candidate. Runtime failures (`runtime_*` health rows, e.g. 429) expire after a cooldown in `latest_health_by_model` (default 10 minutes; a 429's `Retry-After` header, captured by the provider client as the internal `_proxyrouter_retry_after` body marker, overrides it via `provider_health.cooldown_seconds`), so rate-limited models re-enter routing automatically. **Auto-inclusion rule**: when the healthy candidate pool drops below `AUTO_INCLUDE_MIN_HEALTHY` (env, default 3), models degraded *only by runtime failures* (`runtime_degraded_models`) re-enter immediately as last-resort reserves appended after the healthy candidates — hard failures (auth, not found, scanner verdicts) are never re-admitted.
- **In-process routing state** (`app/routing_state.py`, advisory and in-memory — resets on restart, never excludes the last resort): a per-provider **circuit breaker** (`BREAKER_THRESHOLD` consecutive failures open it for `BREAKER_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`; open providers sort last, half-open allows one probe); **sticky routing** (the last model that succeeded for an agent+demand sorts first for `STICKY_TTL_SECONDS` — preserves provider prompt caches); and a 60s-cached `model_performance()` map (route_events success rate + latest scan latency) that feeds `dynamic_score` — `default_chain` bands by static `intelligence_score` but orders within the chain by the dynamic score. Tests must reset this state (autouse fixture in `tests/conftest.py`).
- **Streaming**: `/v1/chat/completions` supports `stream: true` — the provider response is proxied as SSE (`StreamingResponse`, chunk generator in `app/providers/openai_compatible.py`). The payload requests `stream_options.include_usage`; `_stream_and_persist_usage` in `app/main.py` scans the SSE chunks for the final usage object (`usage`, or Groq's `x_groq.usage`) and persists the route event with token counts after the stream completes. `ChatMessage` allows extra fields (`tool_calls`, `tool_call_id`, `name`) for full OpenAI compatibility.
- **DB failures must never break routing.** Every persistence call in the request path is wrapped in try/except; admin endpoints fall back to YAML when the health store is unavailable. Preserve this when adding persistence.
- **Never route to an unhealthy provider**, and never expose secrets — the readiness endpoint returns env var names and a configured boolean only; secrets must not be logged.
- Read-only admin endpoints (`/admin/providers/health`, `/admin/providers/readiness`, `/admin/providers/registry`, `/admin/routes/recent`, `/admin/agents`, `/admin/usage`) are public — they never expose secret values (agent/provider keys are masked), and the dashboard depends on loading them without a token. State-changing endpoints (`POST /admin/providers/rescan` — health-only re-check that skips manually-disabled models and re-enables auto-disabled ones that scan healthy (`models.manual_off`: a dashboard uncheck is permanent, a health-verdict uncheck is revivable), `POST /admin/providers/resync` — full re-discover/catalog/scan of every provider (also respects `manual_off`), `POST /admin/providers/discover-models`, `POST /admin/providers/{name}/validate` — credential check + real call per enabled model, persists health, `PUT /admin/providers/{name}`, `DELETE /admin/providers/{name}`, the agent endpoints `POST /admin/agents`, `POST /admin/agents/{name}/rotate-key`, `POST /admin/agents/{name}/duplicate`, `PUT /admin/agents/{name}/models`, `DELETE /admin/agents/{name}`, and the key-reveal endpoints `GET /admin/providers/{name}/key`, `GET /admin/agents/{name}/key`) require a Bearer token that is either a registered agent's API key (each agent's own AGENTE_API_KEY, stored in `ai_router.agents`) or a dashboard session — there is no master key in the environment. Protection activates automatically once at least one enabled agent exists; with no agents (or no DB) admin stays open for first-time setup.
- **Dashboard login**: `/auth/login`, `/auth/me`, `/auth/change-password`, `/auth/logout` back the frontend login gate. The default `admin`/`admin` user is seeded on first login (`ensure_default_user`) with `must_change_password = true`, and the UI forces a credential change before showing the app. Passwords are PBKDF2-hashed in `ai_router.users`; sessions (7 days) live in `ai_router.sessions`. This gates the dashboard only — `/v1/*` uses agent keys and `/admin/*` keeps its public-read model with state changes gated by agent keys/sessions.
- **Agents**: each connected agent (Athos, Opencode, …) has its own `hermes_*` API key in `ai_router.agents`. A `/v1/chat/completions` bearer key matching an agent attributes the route event to it (`route_events.agent_id`) and, when the agent has rows in `ai_router.agent_models`, restricts routing to those models. Agent lookup failures must never break routing. Rotating the key (`rotate-key`) keeps the agent identity and its model controls; `duplicate` clones the controls into a new agent with a fresh key.
- **Context compaction** (`app/normalize.py`): before building the provider payload, `chat_completions` applies lossless whitespace normalization to every message (trailing whitespace, runs of blank lines collapsed; `role: "tool"` JSON content minified) — no semantic content is removed. Toggled via `ai_router.settings.context_compaction_enabled` (`GET`/`POST /admin/settings/context-compaction`, default `true`, read failures default to enabled). `count_tokens()` (tiktoken `cl100k_base`, lazy-loaded, `None` on failure — never breaks routing) estimates tokens before and after normalization using the same encoding; both are persisted per route event (`prompt_tokens_raw`, `prompt_tokens_compacted`) so `/admin/usage` can report aggregate `tokens_raw`/`tokens_saved`/`pct_saved` (the Overview "Context compaction" card). The estimator is provider-agnostic by design — no per-provider tokenizer/API-type detection.
- **Context truncation** (`app/normalize.py: truncate_messages`, `app/main.py: _summarize_dropped_context`) — **lossy**, unlike the compaction above, and **off by default** (`ai_router.settings.context_truncation_enabled`, `GET`/`POST /admin/settings/context-truncation`; the Overview "Context truncation" card). Added after Athos's own conversation grew to 147k prompt tokens in under an hour with no compaction ever firing (hermes-agent's own compression apparently doesn't track the model ForgeRouter dynamically routes it to). When enabled, once the estimated prompt exceeds `trigger_percent` (default 80, matching hermes-agent's own compression threshold) of the *selected candidate's real context window* — looked up from `app/pricing.py: context_window()`, sourced from the vendored LiteLLM catalog (`config/model_pricing.json`, `max_input_tokens`), falling back to a flat `context_truncation_max_tokens` (default 32k) only when that model isn't in the catalog — `truncate_messages()` drops the oldest *turns* (a user message plus everything up to the next user message, so an assistant `tool_calls` is never separated from its `tool` response) until back under budget. System messages and the final turn (what's actually being answered) are always kept, even alone over budget — nothing left to safely cut. Before discarding, `_summarize_dropped_context` tries to condense the dropped turns with a cheap LLM (the same `forgerouter/simple` chain `auto` would pick) into one system message spliced in ahead of the kept turns, instructed to preserve names/decisions/numbers/paths; any failure in that call (bad response, no candidate, provider error, exception) silently falls back to the plain drop — a missing summary is always safe, a request that never gets answered isn't. `route_events.messages_dropped` records how many messages were cut per request, shown on the Messages page detail row.

## Database

PostgreSQL is Foundation-managed (separate `forgerouter` database, `proxyrouter_user` user, `ai_router` schema — rationale in `docs/DATABASE_DECISION.md`). Connection comes from `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` (never commit `.env`). Schema/seed SQL lives in `db/*.sql` (numbered files, applied manually — there is no migration tool). Tables: `providers` (with `access_type` subscription/api_key/local, `cost_type` free/paid, `api_format` openai/anthropic — the endpoint's wire protocol, `auth_config` JSONB for subscription particularities like extra headers — tokens always go in `api_key`), `models`, `provider_health` (append-only health history), `route_events` (one row per provider attempt, with `agent_id` attribution; `reference_cost` is the notional cost estimate from `app/pricing.py`, only ever set when the real `cost` is absent/zero; `prompt_preview` is the first ~100 chars of the last user message, the one deliberate exception to never persisting conversation content, for audit visibility on the Messages page; `messages_dropped` is how many messages context truncation cut from that request, if any), `usage_monthly` (per-agent/year/month rollup written by `POST /admin/usage/archive`, mirrors `cost` and `reference_cost` so yearly usage survives raw-row pruning), `agents` (per-agent API keys), `agent_models` (per-agent model controls), `users` + `sessions` (dashboard login), `subscription_catalog` (seeded coding-plan providers listed by `GET /admin/subscriptions/catalog`), `settings` (generic key/value — `pricing_last_synced` is the ISO timestamp of the last `POST /admin/pricing/sync`). Migrations must be applied as the `foundation` superuser (`docker exec -i foundation_postgres psql -U foundation -d forgerouter`) — `proxyrouter_user` does not own the tables. Models are joined by `public_id` (e.g. `local/qwen2.5:1.5b`), which must match the `id` in `config/providers.yaml`.

## Testing conventions

Tests use FastAPI's `TestClient` and monkeypatch the names imported into `app.main` (e.g. `monkeypatch.setattr("app.main.load_registry_with_db_health", ...)`, `"app.main.chat_completion"`, `"app.main.persist_route_event"`) — no live DB or providers are needed. `pyproject.toml` sets `pythonpath = ["."]` for pytest.
